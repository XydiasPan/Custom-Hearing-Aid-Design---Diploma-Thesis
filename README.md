-- Hearing aid design and implementation with microcontroller --
   The topic of this dissertation is the design and implementation of a microelectronic device capable of simulating the operation of a hearing aid. The purpose of this work is the practical utilization of the basic theoretical knowledge of microelectronic and embedded systems. Initially, the parameters that determine the technical specifications of the system to be implemented were analyzed, according to globally accepted data collected in previous research, in combination with the hearing requirements of a hearing-impaired person, namely the author of this dissertation. Then the microcontroller and the necessary integrated circuits were selected, of which the device will consist in its final version. The next step was that of simulations and performing measurements on a test board with the help of laboratory equipment. Finally, the physical design and completion of the project was done on a unique PCB board. The results during the operation of the hearing aid device were satisfactory and are in line with what emerged during the simulation
